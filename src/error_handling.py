# Quantum Simulation Project - error_handling.py
# This module provides a robust framework for error handling and reporting in the simulation.

def handle_error(error_message):
    # A simple error handling function that logs and possibly terminates the simulation on critical errors
    print(f"ERROR: {error_message}")
    # Here, more sophisticated error management could be implemented, such as error logging to a file
    # or notifying an administrator via email or a monitoring system.
