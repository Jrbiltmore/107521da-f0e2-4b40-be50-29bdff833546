# User Guide

Welcome to the user guide for the quantum simulation project! This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the simulation software effectively.

## Installation

Before using the quantum simulation software, ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, follow these steps to set up the simulation environment:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/quantum_simulation_project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd quantum_simulation_project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Simulation

To run the quantum simulation, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory if you're not already there:
   ```
   cd quantum_simulation_project
   ```

2. Open the `config.json` file and adjust the simulation parameters as needed. This file contains configurable parameters such as lattice size, temperature, and simulation duration.

3. Run the main script `main.py`:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. Monitor the simulation progress in the console output. Once the simulation is complete, the results will be saved to the specified output directory.

## Analyzing Results

After running the simulation, you can analyze the results using various tools and techniques. Here's how:

1. Navigate to the output directory specified in the `config.json` file.

2. Review the generated CSV files containing simulation results. These files contain data such as energy calculations and information metrics.

3. Use visualization tools such as matplotlib or seaborn to create plots and graphs for visualizing simulation results.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while installing or running the simulation software, refer to the following resources:

- Check the README.md file for troubleshooting tips and common issues.
- Review the technical documentation for detailed information about the simulation implementation.
- Reach out to the project maintainers or community for assistance on the project's GitHub repository.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the quantum simulation using the provided software. Experiment with different simulation parameters and analysis techniques to gain deeper insights into quantum systems.

For more information and updates, refer to the project's documentation and community forums.
