# Setup Instructions

These setup instructions will guide you through the process of setting up the quantum simulation environment on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can use the quantum simulation environment by executing the provided Python scripts or by importing the modules into your own Python projects.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to consult the documentation for detailed information on using the simulation environment and its features.
- For advanced usage and customization, explore the source code and modify it according to your requirements.
- If you encounter any issues during setup or usage, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers for assistance.
